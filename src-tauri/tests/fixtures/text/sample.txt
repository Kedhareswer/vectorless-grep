Plain Text Document

This is a plain text file without any special formatting or markup.

It contains multiple paragraphs separated by blank lines.

The parser should detect headings based on heuristics like short lines, capitalization, and lack of sentence-ending punctuation.

SECTION ONE

This section has an all-caps heading which should be detected by the heading heuristics.

The content here is regular paragraph text that should be chunked appropriately.

SECTION TWO

Another section with similar structure and content for testing purposes.

This helps validate that the parser correctly identifies multiple sections in plain text files.
